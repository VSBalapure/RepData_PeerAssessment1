#Introduction
This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. 
This device collects data at 5 minute intervals throughout the day. The data 
consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during 
the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken 
in 5 minute intervals each day.

This document presents the results from Project Assignment 1 in the Coursera 
course Reproducible Research, written in a single R markdown document that 
can be processed by knitr and transformed into an HTML file.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Read the dataset
```{r}
data <- read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE, 
                 sep = ',', colClasses = c("numeric", "character","integer"))
```
##Tidying the data
Change the date into dateformat using lubridate:
```{R}
data$date <- ymd(data$date)
```
## check the data 
```{r}
str(data)
head(data)
```
Now we are ready to solve the problem 
##Question 1 - What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
For this part of the assignment the missing values can be ignored.

1. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day.
2. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day.
3. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken 
per day.

### Analysis Begin 
1. Calculate the total number of steps per day using dplyr and group by date:
```{r}
steps <- data %>%
  filter(!is.na(steps)) %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarize(steps = sum(steps)) %>%
  print
```
2. Use ggplot for making the histogram:
```{r}
ggplot(steps, aes(x = steps)) +  geom_histogram(fill = "firebrick", binwidth = 1000) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Steps per day", x = "Steps per day", y = "Frequency")
```
3.Calculate the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day:
```{r}
mean_steps <- mean(steps$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
median_steps <- median(steps$steps, na.rm = TRUE)

mean_steps
median_steps
```
## Question 2 - What is the average daily activity pattern?
1. Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) 
and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis).
2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, 
contains the maximum number of steps?.
###Analysis Begins
1. Calculate the average number of steps taken in each 5-minute interval per day
using dplyr and group by interval:
```{r}
interval <- data %>%
  filter(!is.na(steps)) %>%
  group_by(interval) %>%
  summarize(steps = mean(steps))
```
Use ggplot for making the time series of the 5-minute interval and average steps
taken:
```{r}
ggplot(interval, aes(x=interval, y=steps)) +
  geom_line(color = "firebrick")
```

2.Use which.max() to find out the maximum steps, on average, across all the days:
```{r}
interval[which.max(interval$steps),]
```

##Imputing missing values
Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing values 
(coded as NA). The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some 
calculations or summaries of the data.

1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset 
(i.e. the total number of rows with NAs).
2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. 
The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the 
mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.
3.Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the 
missing data filled in.
4.Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and calculate and
report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values
differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the 
impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of 
steps?

### Analysis Begins
1. Summarize all the missing values:
```{r}
sum(is.na(data$steps))
```
2. Let's take the approach to fill in a missing NA with the average number of 
steps in the same 5-min interval.
3.Create a new dataset as the original and use tapply for filling in the missing
values with the average number of steps per 5-minute interval:
```{r}
data_full <- data
nas <- is.na(data_full$steps)
avg_interval <- tapply(data_full$steps, data_full$interval, mean, na.rm=TRUE, 
                       simplify=TRUE)
data_full$steps[nas] <- avg_interval[as.character(data_full$interval[nas])]
```
Check that there are no missing values:
```{r}
sum(is.na(data_full$steps))
```
No more missing values.

Calculate the number of steps taken in each 5-minute interval per day using 
dplyr and group by interval. Use ggplot for making the histogram:
```{r}
steps_full <- data_full %>%
  filter(!is.na(steps)) %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarize(steps = sum(steps)) %>%
  print
ggplot(steps_full, aes(x = steps)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "firebrick", binwidth = 1000) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Steps per day, including missing values", 
       x = "Steps per day", y = "Frequency")

```
Calculate the mean and median steps with the filled in values:
```{r}
mean_steps_full <- mean(steps_full$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
median_steps_full <- median(steps_full$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
mean_steps_full
median_steps_full
```
The impact of imputing missing data with the average number of steps in the same 
5-min interval is that both the mean and the median are equal to the 
same value: 10766.

##Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
For this part the weekdays() will come handy. Use the dataset with the filled-in 
missing values for this part.

1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels - "weekday" and 
"weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
2.Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 
5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged 
across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).

### Analysis Begins
1.Use dplyr and mutate to create a new column, weektype, and apply whether the 
day is weekend or weekday:
```{r}
data_full <- mutate(data_full, weektype = ifelse(weekdays(data_full$date) == "Saturday" | weekdays(data_full$date) == "Sunday", "weekend", "weekday"))
data_full$weektype <- as.factor(data_full$weektype)
head(data_full)
```
2. Calculate the average steps in the 5-minute interval and use ggplot for 
making the time series of the 5-minute interval for weekday and weekend, and 
compare the average steps:
```{r}
interval_full <- data_full %>%
  group_by(interval, weektype) %>%
  summarise(steps = mean(steps))
s <- ggplot(interval_full, aes(x=interval, y=steps, color = weektype)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~weektype, ncol = 1, nrow=2)
print(s)
```

From the two plots it seems that the test object is more active earlier in the day during weekdays compared to weekends, but more active throughout the weekends compared with weekdays (probably because the oject is working during the weekdays, hence moving less during the day).
